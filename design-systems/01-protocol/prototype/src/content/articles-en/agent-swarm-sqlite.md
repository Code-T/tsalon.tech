On July 20, 2026, Cursor’s Wilson Lin published [Agent swarms and the new model economics](https://cursor.com/blog/agent-swarm-model-economics), describing a swarm building a Rust implementation from SQLite documentation. This T Salon editorial analysis focuses on coordination across design, code and shared experience. We have not independently reproduced the experiment.

## What the test results measure

According to [Cursor’s experimental setup and results](https://cursor.com/blog/agent-swarm-model-economics), the agents received SQLite documentation while source code, test suites, the SQLite binary and internet access were withheld. Evaluation used a held-out `sqllogictest` suite that the agents were not told about.

The new Grok 4.5 swarm reached roughly 80% in four hours; the old run was paused before its second hour. Cursor also reports that every new configuration eventually passed the suite. “100%” describes that benchmark, not demonstrated compatibility, durability, performance or reliability across production SQLite workloads. It does not mean every configuration reached 100% within four hours.

The useful question is how coordination changes effective output. More commits or longer runs do not necessarily produce a more complete implementation.

## Tree decomposition separates planning from implementation

In this architecture, work is split into a tree with two roles:

- **Planners** divide goals, make design decisions and delegate work without writing implementation code.
- **Workers** implement narrow tasks without taking responsibility for global planning.

This reduces the pressure to fit both the global design and every implementation detail into one context window. The author offers context efficiency as an explanation for the improvement; it is not a universal diagnosis of why single agents fail.

The experiment also compares model roles, including Fable 5 planners with Composer 2.5 workers. The engineering implication is that planning and execution can be evaluated separately for quality and cost. The best combination still depends on the task, rework and actual billing.

## Why version control became a coordination layer

[Cursor describes](https://cursor.com/blog/agent-swarm-model-economics) lock contention in existing tools under its highly concurrent workload, and reports peaks around 1,000 commits per second in the new system. Its custom VCS exposes collisions and hosts some coordination mechanisms directly in the change workflow.

This does not establish that Git crashes whenever agents collaborate. Our editorial recommendation is to identify whether the bottleneck is locking, merging, file structure or overlapping work before building custom infrastructure. At lower concurrency, work isolation and a merge queue may be a more appropriate starting point.

## Five coordination problems and the experiment’s responses

The following mechanisms come from [Cursor’s failure-mode discussion](https://cursor.com/blog/agent-swarm-model-economics). They describe this system rather than a required architecture for every swarm.

### 1. Split-brain design

Two planners can independently answer the same design question in incompatible ways. Cursor requires planners to make decisions themselves and avoid assigning the same decision to different subtrees.

The practical lesson is to define who owns an interface decision before splitting its implementation. Small coding tasks can still conceal overlapping design responsibilities.

### 2. Contention between planners

Text merging cannot resolve disagreement about the design. The system records decisions in shared documents, uses compile-checked references from dependent code and assigns a reconciler to resolve conflicting documents and propagate the result.

Contention describes conflicting edits, not malicious intent. The issue to manage is how decisions collide and reach dependent work.

### 3. Merge conflicts

Workers sometimes overwrite another agent’s change or abandon their own when resolving a collision. An independent merge agent takes responsibility for reconciling the competing context.

This makes ownership of merging explicit. It does not guarantee a correct result: the resulting code still needs project validation.

### 4. Megafiles

Many small additions to one file can accumulate without anyone owning its decomposition. Transport, diff and merge costs rise. Workers can flag oversized files, pause new commits to them and hand decomposition to a dedicated agent.

For an existing project, repeatedly contested files and concentrated edits can be more useful signals than agent count alone.

### 5. Ossification

To avoid endless workarounds around flawed core code, the experiment allows focused changes beyond an agent’s assigned scope, accompanied by an explanation. Compiler failures expose dependent modules, whose agents can then read the rationale and adapt.

This relies on traceable reasoning and meaningful compile checks. Applying it elsewhere requires attention to rollback and test coverage, rather than unrestricted permission to make breaking changes.

## Review perspectives and shared experience

**Review Lenses** give reviewers different views: the full work transcript, the output or the codebase, with different models also tested. Multiple perspectives may find complementary problems. The reported experiment supplies no human vulnerability-detection baseline for a claim of superior-to-human security review.

The **Field Guide** is a shared directory maintained by the agents. Its `index.md` is loaded at startup, and a line budget limits the accumulated notes. This makes environmental knowledge available to later tasks; the author still describes it as an early experiment.

## Four checks before applying the design

These are editorial recommendations drawn from the case:

1. **Can work be separated?** Clarify interfaces and decision ownership before multiple agents answer the same question.
2. **Can decisions propagate?** Dependent implementations need to recognize changes in the architecture.
3. **Are coordination costs visible?** Track conflict, duplication and rework alongside useful output.
4. **Do the tests match the goal?** Identify whether a score covers query results, compatibility or performance, and which production requirements remain untested.

These checks provide a starting point for an experiment. The SQLite case offers coordination mechanisms to investigate; the value for a particular project still depends on its own results and costs.
